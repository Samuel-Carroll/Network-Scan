# Network-Scan
Network Scanner
A simple network scanner made in python that will scan a network periodicly given a target ip. The information from the arp response is written to text file with the current time of when the scan was completed. The way the scanner works is that we send out a arp request. The arp request contains the ip address of our target (in this case the ip address that the user inputs). This request is broadcasted across the network, and when the request reaches a device with an identical ip to our request it will respond with its Mac address to the device that sent out the request, this is an arp response. This information is then written down to a text file and the program will then scan again every 15 minutes allowing the us to see if any devices have disconnected or connected to the network.
